## Examples of Links. 

Both types of link syntax work.

You can write links as regular markdown links:
[Click here](https://twitter.com/neilxm)

Or as Obsidian wikilinks. When linking to other posts

## Examples of Images

Both types of image insert syntax work as well. 

You can insert images as regular markdown syntax:
![](/images/test_image_1.jpg)

Or as Obsidian syntax. Obsidian adds images use just file names, so our code fills in the full image path as `/images/file_name.jpg`

![[test_image_2.jpg]]

## Example of Code Highlighting
This is how code syntax highlighting works:

```js
console.log("hello world")
```
